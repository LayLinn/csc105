                This week, I’ve learned how internet work in general, step by step on how the server handle user’s
                activities and websites. Later I also get to work on making a personal website as a portfolio. But
                the
                odd
                thing about it was- having to write that page without using CSS, Javascript, or any sort of
                assistance
                apart from just vanilla html. It was pretty challenging to make it looks decent. As the
                visual/beauty
                aspect of a website nowadays usually requires CSS. After this I realised how important CSS is for
                making a
                website. And without it, life as a web developer would be hard, and websites would look less
                appealing
                for
                clients that’s going to use the website. However. After this lesson, I actually learned new HTML
                tags
                that
                I never knew about before, and that you can actually style websites quite a bit by just using those
                HTML
                tags. The existence of CSS made these tags seems less important and make people forget about them.</p>

                This week, the material is about the components and semantics of HTML, how to put they work
                together,
                and I get to learn a bit about CSS, which is used to style the websites. I get to learn how
                “position”
                property work in CSS, it was a confusing topic for me, and I couldn’t understand it back then.
                Thanks
                to the visual demonstrations, this concept became so much easier to grasp. For this week’s lab
                session,
                I get to try redesigning a webpage, during this, I also learned how to organise things in CSS, and
                how
                to put together CSS properties to make a page that looks more attractive for users.
                I get to make use of “display: flex” property, which is used to make a responsive website, and
                other
                positioning properties to arrange the elements in the way that I wanted.</p>

                This week, the focus is mainly on manipulating image elements, stylesheets, and one of important
                topic
                for responsive web design, which is media query. I get to fixed a sample site, making it work on
                both
                mobile and desktop devices. I think media query is really handy for making your website looks good
                on
                different devices, and I find it better than always scaling elements, because in some case, scaling
                makes your elements looks ridiculous on certain resolutions</p>

                I find this week interesting, as I get to work on a page of my own, the main focus Is on using
                Bootstrap, but I basically had to design most of the things. I rely heavily on media query to make
                the
                page looks decent on all type of devices. I decided to make the HTML and CSS more organised, by
                using
                grouped class names, separating elements into different section, making it easier to come back and
                modify them later on. I use Bootstrap to make my images responsive, and I used Navbar component,
                and
                made some changes over it to make it fits my page more. I find the Navbar really handy, because it
                scales nicely on different devices, and turns into a dropdown menu on mobile devices.</p>

            <p class="section__content">
                This week, I get to learn more about CSS selectors, it might be useful in many situations where you
                have different components of the same type, and you need to make changes differently for each of
                them.
                It’s pretty neat.</p>

                This week I get to study about CSS box model, and how div takes the space, learning how to
                manipulate
                them more precisely, and using more media queries to help making responsive image grids, that works
                differently depending on the size of the device.</p>
